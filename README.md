# The Chillout App
*A modern web radio platform.*

Although nowadays we mostly enjoy our favorite radios online, we miss the ease of using the FM tuner to swap to that other
station and satisfy our music taste intricacies; web radios are scattered and those pages that try to gather them into one place
are rather primitive and non-interactive.

This app is an attempt to solve this problem by introducing a contemporary and interactive platform that combines a customizable
collection of radios and an audio player in a single lightweight page, promising a modern and refined experience.

## Usage
Simply click on a radio you like and enjoy the music! [Take me to the chillout.](https://kostaslib.github.io/chillout/)
